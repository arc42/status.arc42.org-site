| Element | Responsibility | Code

| main
| Golang requires a "main" func as entry point in the application.
|

| api gateway
| an http server with several predefined routes. This server is called from the public website, dispatches to domain and returns either plain html to the static site (or other formats when called via the upcoming technical API)
|`internal/api`

| domain
| core functionality, coordination of various subsystems, results collection
|

| types
| a few data types and -structures used by other parts. Extracted from the domain to avoid circular dependencies.
|

| github
| wrapper for the public GitHub (graphql) API. We query several repository infos (e.g. nr of open issues, bugs and pull-requests).
|

|database
|wrapper for https://turso.tech[Turso], an SQLite clone running in the cloud. We store some usage and operations data, and wanted to avoid hosting our own DB.
|

|fly.io
|wrapper for the https://fly.io[fly.io API], which we use to find out the server region where our application is deployed. Not to be confused with our _hosting and deployment_ concept.
